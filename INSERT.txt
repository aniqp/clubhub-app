Are you looking to develop speaking, presentation, and leadership skills? Ace a job interview? Ignite your career? Or want to have fun by sharing your thoughts?

UW Public Speaking Club is filled with inquisitive and enthusiastic members. We bond and learn together through weekly meetings (Thursdays 5:30 - 6:45 pm), competitions, workshops, and social events. Associated with Agora Speakers International, we engage participants through a series of prepared and impromptu speeches strongly supported by meeting roles.

How Does It Work?

Our meetings follow a structure of a learn-by-doing format, in which participants hone their speaking and leadership skills in a no-pressure atmosphere. There are no instructors or judges, instead, members evaluate one another’s presentations. This feedback process is a key part of the program’s success.

Meeting participants also give impromptu talks on assigned topics, conduct meetings, and develop skills related to timekeeping, grammar, speech analysis, and evaluation. Members go through a journey of personal and professional development by working through Pathways, an education program designed to develop competencies in
communication and leadership.

Guests and visitors are welcome to come to as many meetings as they want before deciding whether to join as formal club members.
